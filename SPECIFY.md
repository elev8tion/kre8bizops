# SPECIFY.md - ELEV8TION Local Business Management Platform

## What We're Building

A **single-user business management platform** that runs entirely in your browser with no backend, no database server, and no internet dependency. This is your personal business command center that stores all data locally on your computer.

## Why This Exists

**Problem:** AGILED is a multi-user SaaS platform requiring subscriptions, internet, and sharing data with servers. You want:
- Complete data ownership
- No recurring costs
- Offline capability
- Single-user simplicity
- Beautiful, modern UI

**Solution:** A local-first clone that does everything AGILED does, but stores everything in your browser's localStorage.

## Core Principles

1. **Local-First** - All data lives in localStorage, never leaves your machine
2. **Single-User** - No authentication complexity, no team features, optimized for solo use
3. **Offline-Always** - Works without internet, no external dependencies
4. **Data Portability** - Export/import your entire business data as JSON
5. **Beautiful UX** - Cosmic-themed UI that's a joy to use
